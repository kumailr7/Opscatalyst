### Read capacity
1. One _read capacity unit_ represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size
2. Transactional read requests require two read capacity units to perform one read per second for items up to 4 KB

### Write capacity
1. One _write capacity unit_ represents one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size
2. Transactional write requests require 2 write capacity units to perform one write per second for items up to 1 KB

### Managed Backup: Point-in-time recovery
- A backup is auto created when table is deleted, naming convention of ``table-name$DeletedTableBackup``

>[!caution] Restoring from backup
>We need to restore the backup to a different table, cant restore in-place
