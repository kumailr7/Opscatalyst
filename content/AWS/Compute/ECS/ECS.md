## Abstract
---

- A lightweight container orchestration service
- We can mount [[#Volume]] to it for data that can't be lost when [[#Container]] is terminated

## Components
---

### Container

- We can obtain a shell into it using [[ECS Exec]]
- Obtain Private IP of the container, must have [[curl]] && [[jq]]

```bash
containerPrivateIP=$(curl $ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI | jq -r '.Networks[0].IPv4Addresses[0]') >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### Task

- A logical grouping of one or more [[#Container]]

### Task Definition

- Similar to **EC2 Launch Template**
- Required to spin up [[#Task]]
- It defines the *Hardware Details*, [[IAM Role]], [[Docker Image]] and [[Docker Container]] Config (AMI Config like User Data Script)
>[!tip]  Hardware Details
>- `"cpu": 256` means 256/1024 vCPU
>- Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-cpu-memory-error.html) to find out more about the hardware configuration




### Service

- Similar to [[Auto Scaling Group]] in [[EC2]]
>[!info] Defines
>- What [[#Task Definition]] to use
>- [[VPC]] (like which [[VPC Subnet]] to use)
>- Connecting to [[AWS ALB]] & [[Target Group]]
>- [[Auto Scaling Group]]

## Terminologies

### Volume

- 2 types - `Bind Mounts` & `EFS Volumes`
- [[ECS Fargate]] can only use `EFS Volumes`, `Bind Mounts` are local file system volumes mounted directly from the host to the container. But [[ECS Fargate]] is [[Serverless]]

### Fargate

- The **serverless** version of [[ECS]]
- The one and only one **Deployment Strategy** is **Spread**
- Doesn't have control over Deployment Strategy like the ECS powered by [[EC2]]. Because Fargate is serverless, so we don't really have to consider which az's ec2 instance has more cpu power, thus deploy new task to that ec2 in that az
