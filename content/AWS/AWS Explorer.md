title: Manage Your AWS from Code Editor without Console Hassles
---
## Abstract
---
- Solves the pain of going into the AWS Console or copy-paste commands to access the resources created
- Instead, do it inside your code editor!

## Features I Like
---
- Read and edit [[File]] in S3 buckets (file size need to be `<=50MB`)
- Live monitoring of Cloudwatch logs (we can limit the time range)
- SSH into [[ECS]] without manually copy-paste the command (Make sure [[ECS Exec]] is enabled first)
- Access Lambda functions locally (update, download & trigger)

## Setup
---
**1. Download The AWS Toolkit Extension**
