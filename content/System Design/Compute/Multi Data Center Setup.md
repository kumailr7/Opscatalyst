- System workload is shared by different data centers to stay [[System Design#Availability (可用性)]] and [[System Design#Fault Tolerance (容错性)]]

## Things to Note
---
### Traffic Redirection
- Effective tools are needed to direct traffic to the correct data center
- [[DNS#geoDNS]] can be used to direct traffic to the nearest data center depending on where a user is located

### Data Synchronization
 - Users from different regions could use different local [[Database]] or [[Cache Server]]
 - In failover cases, traffic might be routed to a data center where data is unavailable
 - A common strategy is to replicate data across multiple data centers. Like the asynchronous multi-data center replication by Netflix

### Test and Deployment
- Automated deployment tools like [[Terraform]] are vital to keep services consistent through all the data centers
